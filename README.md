Tasks
-----

1. The Darth would have the option to decrypt the entire file and display its contents in plain text.
2. From the details of the Rebel bases and their channels of communication, the Darth would like to have an option which when chosen would display a graph showing each Rebel base and the connections it has with the other bases i.e. the software would display the graph with the bases as the nodes and the channels as the edges.
3. As a strategy for shattering the organization and trust among the Rebel bases, the Darth would require an option which when chosen would alter the “Messages” section of the file such no two adjacent bases in the graph would receive the same message. The number of new messages should be optimized i.e. the different types of messages to be sent should be minimal.
